            <P>Famous for his intense use of chiaroscuro, or the dramatic use of light and shadow, this Italian from the Baroque period was well loved for his art, but notorious with authorities for drunken brawls.

            <p>This form of printmaking uses a plate of copper, zinc, or steel, coated in a waxy or acrylic ground. The artist could then use a needle to carve into the ground, exposing the metal underneath. An acidic solution was then used on the exposed metal to create a reusable plate to create prints. This printmaking form was especially easy to learn if the artist was already competent in drawing.</p>
